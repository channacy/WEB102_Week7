## Notes

Challenges was connecting to the database and debugging the issue. It took looking at each keyword and comparing the column names on Supabase website and the ones in the code to determine if there was a typo or bug in the mismatch of the name. Another difficulty was displaying all the posts because there had to be another component called Card, to store every "post" in an organized manner.
